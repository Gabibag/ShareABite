# Share A Bite - A Hacakthon Project

Yeah ill updates stuff later for now here are commands that are useful

`pip install -r requirements.txt` - installs imports for you. \
`python3 initdb.py` - overwrites your db to input dummy values. \
`flask --app app run` - runs the server. \
`flask --app app --deubug run` - runs the server but on debug mode, meaning pages automatically update without having to restart server.
